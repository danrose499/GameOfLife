Conway's Game of Life
(written in x86 Assembly)
===============
When the program begins, it displays some instructions on how to
set up the board, and prompts the user to enter a key to begin.
An initial 50x80 board of dead cells is then printed to video memory.
To move around the board, you use the arrow keys. The space bar
toggles the selected cell from dead to alive and vice verca.
Pressing 's' during  the setup stage saves the current layout of
the board and pressing 'l' during the setup stage restores the most
recently saved board. When ready to begin the game, the user must
press enter.
